# Setup

Notes to future self.

## Get the boilerplate

After cloning the repo in your home (~), create or update ~/.bash_profile to:
`source ~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile`

If you use vim, do the same with ~/.vimrc, except:
`source ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc`

## Machine specific

Anything that's specific to the machine you're on goes into the default dotfiles.
